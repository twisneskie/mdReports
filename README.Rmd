## Purpose

## Folder Organization

## General development notes:
Many metadata sections are stored in lists within their columns and must be unnested to be accessed

## Session Information
```{r session.info, echo = FALSE}

sessionInfo()

```

Data was last downloaded from the Regional Data Repository on `r as_date(file.info("test-data\\rdr-data.Rda")$mtime)`.
